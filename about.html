### Who am I and what do I do?

**Ronan Berder**, alias **Teddy** or **小熊 (xiǎo xióng)**, a 29 years old Frech engineer working and living in Shanghai. I founded and currently run [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com), a Web development company providing services revolving around Open Source technologies and more specifically the [Drupal CMS](http://drupal.org).

I am a Jack of all trades, juggling with design, User Interface, development, scalability and server management. When not geeking or drawing, you may find me around Shanghai skating or creating opportunities to practice my Chinese.

If you're looking for more, you can [browse my CV](/ronan-berders-cv) or [contact me](/contact).

### What is this website for ?

This place is mainly a repository for my rumblings about technology, Shanghai or the differences between African and Europeans swallows.

Spending most of my time working on the Web for my clients, I rarely find the energy to do the same for myself, including updating this blog.
