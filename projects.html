<h3>
  [Antenna Mate](http://antennamate.com) 
  <span>(Proprietary, Objective-C)</span>
</h3>
<p>Take the guess work out of pointing a TV antenna. Within seconds [Antenna Mate](http://antennamate.com) will accurately point to the direction of your closest broadcasting site from anywhere in Australia. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caraveners and DIYers from city and country areas. It's so easy anyone can use it. Antenna Mate is available on the App Store.</p>
<p>I've written about [planning the future]({{ base.url }}/2011/01/08/reflecting-on-my-first-iphone-app-antenna-mate/">my reflections on iOS development</a> and <a href="{{ base.url }}/2011/01/09/planning-the-future-of-antenna-mate/) of Antenna Mate.</p>

  [Aviary](https://github.com/tatey/aviary)
  <span>(Open source, Ruby)</span>
</h3>
<p>[Aviary](https://github.com/tatey/aviary) is a Ruby gem that generates a static photo gallery using Twitter. Twitter is a fantastic resource for discovering photos of events as they unfold. Searching using your preferred client means you have to do the filtering. Commentary and relinking drown new and interesting photos. In the days the water rose during the 2011 Brisbane floods I wished there was a way to see all the photos without the noise. Now there is.</p>

  [Conformist](https://github.com/tatey/conformist)
  <span>(Open source, Ruby)</span>
</h3>
<p>Bend CSVs to your will. Let multiple, different input files conform to a single interface without rewriting your parser each time.</p>
<p>Motivation for this project came from the desire to simplify importing data from various government organisations into Antenna Mate. The data from each government was similar, but had completely different formatting. Some pieces of data needed preprocessing while others simply needed to be concatenated together. I did not want to write a new parser for each new government organisation. Instead, I created [Conformist](https://github.com/tatey/conformist) and made it available as a Ruby gem.</p>

<h3>
  [Zoomable Type](http://zoomabletype.tatey.com/)
  <span>(Open source, JavaScript)</span>
</h3>
<p>[Zoomable Type](http://zoomabletype.tatey.com/) is a jQuery plugin for reading small text on a display from far away. Text is upscaled to the largest size based on its width and the browser's viewport. The project was inspired by the "Show in large type" functionality found in Address Book for Mac OS X.</p>
