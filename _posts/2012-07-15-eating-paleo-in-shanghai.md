I switched from being a vegetarian to the [Paleo diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet) end of last year. I can't tell how much I am pleased with that decision, so much in fact that I have happily converted a few friends to it (and I can't remember ever trying to convince anybody of the benefits of being vegetarian).

If you're not familiar with it, there are plenty of sites out there doing a great job at explaning the idea. I myself read [Nom Nom Paleo](http://nomnompaleo.com/) and [Mark Sisson's blog](http://nomnompaleo.com/) on a regular basis. Some of the key concepts behind it; eat natural (no processed foods), avoid carbs and sugar and go crazy on greens and meat. No calory counting, no strict regimen to stick to, just sound advices on eating simple, healthy (and yummy) food.

Since [my company](http://wiredcraft.com) requires I split my time between our Shanghai and Washington DC offices, I can confirm there is a striking contrast in the scope of options offered to paleo addicts between the two countries. When in the US, Whole Foods or any decent grocery does the trick. Shanghai can be a tad more challenging;

1. Dining out is a very affordable option (luckily I love cooking and so every day),
1. Supermarkets like City Shop propose a lot of imported food and a decent selection of vegetables, but can be outrageously expensive (100 RMB for a jar of olives, really?),
1. The selection from local places can be pretty disorienting; lots of products you are not familiar with, which makes it hard to know how to prepare it, moreover freshness varies greatly (which is fine if you fry everything like most Chinese do, but I'm a sucker for salads),

Now you can always pull out the joker card; the ["avocado lady"](http://shanghaiist.com/2011/04/01/the_avocado_lady_expanding_options.php#photo-1). Sure, but it definitely isn't a day to day option for me.

This leads me to the little circuit that I've starting following about 5 years ago; get my running gears on, grab my backpack and run down the Tianzifang area. I usually get a good mix of greens, meat, nuts and dried fruits;

1. **涂跃华's shop on Ruijin lu (#223)**; it's been my go to shop for buiyin nuits and dried fruits for a solid 5 years now. I especially recommend the roasted almonds, chestnuts, dried bananas and apricots. I usually fill up on these babies before hopping on a plane; try mixing apricots and almonds, it's adictive. If you're the paleo diet, go easy on these babies.

1. **Covered market on Taikang lu**; this market is located on Taikang lu, right about the middle of the street. If you exit from Tianzifang, you should have no issue finding it. Get in through the West entrance, go straight towards the center of it and try to find the lady from the picture below; she has a list of vegetables in English and their equivalent in Chinese. You'll be able to stack up on fresh mint, basil, parsil, avocado, lemongrass, all kind of salads (roman, iceberg...) as well as the more regular stuff (peppers, garlic, mushrooms, lemons...). Her products look really good and she's definitely fun to chat with; I've been to that location for a good 5 years too. I don't really buy fruits anymore but there are stands for that too, along with some selling spices and sauces.
