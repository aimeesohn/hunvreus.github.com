The new skin has been uploaded. There are still a few errors with Internet Explorer due to the use of the PNG file format on some of the pictures. I usually try to avoid the GIF format in my works but it seems I won't have the choice here.

This skin should be more readable than the previous one. I am now going to start uploading articles...
