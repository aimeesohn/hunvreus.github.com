I see a lot of smart people around me struggling with what they see as insurmountable tasks; **they just think about it too hard**.

Now, I am not pretending to be some kind of Tim Ferriss guru, I won't tell you how you can get your stuff done and then some in a matter of hours. I don't get to the bottom of my todo list, ever. But I do register progress on a fairly regular basis, through burn out and busy weeks.

See, the trick is to not use that big brain of yours too much; don't try to wrap your head around the whole problem, just slice it up in smaller, more actionable chunks. Then slice it up some more. It's a redoubtable tool, slicing. I don't consider myself much smarter than a lot of people I meet, what I do think I have in larger amount than the average is stamina, or at least it looks like it to others.
